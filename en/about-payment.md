# About Price & Payment

## About Price

The price of Pro projects is listed in our [Pricing page](https://site.altizure.com/pricing). 


Generally speaking, the price of a Pro project depends on the [**Data Size**](data-size-storage-size-model-size.html#data) of the project. The size is measured as the total resolution of all images. The more images you have, the better the reconstruction result will be, and the project will cost more.


For corporate cooperation or any other questions related to our price, please contact **sales@altizure.com**.
