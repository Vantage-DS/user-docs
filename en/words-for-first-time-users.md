## Words for Novice in 3D Reconstruction Area

#### Welcome to Altizure.com!

Start your journey on Altizure and build a 3D model from 2D photos.

But "What is 3D reconstruction?"

Simply put, you can build a 3D model with a number of photos that you shoot.

Just take out your drone, smart phone or any other camera equipment, and start taking photos of an object or an area. Then, upload those photos to Altizure.com and start a fully automatic 3D reconstruct process.

After waiting for a few hours or sometimes even for a few minutes, you can have a 3D model of the object or area that you have captured. Sounds easy?

The whole process can be summarized as follows:

**Register at Altizure.com** &gt;&gt;

**Create a project** and **upload images** &gt;&gt;

**Wait for the 3D reconstruction process to finish** &gt;&gt;** **

**Edit or share your 3D model with other users in Altizure community or present it to your clients**.

We'll guide you through the whole process. Now, let's begin! [&gt;&gt;&gt;](chapter1.md)
