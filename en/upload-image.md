## Features of Smart Upload {#features}

When you are uploading photos, the machine can **automatically skip** the already-uploaded images if the image file has the same name and the same size.

So, when the upload accidentally stops, you can always simply **select all images** and upload, even if you just want to add few new images into the project. Altizure automatically skips all already-uploaded, and only upload the new images.

If you want to reconstruct a large project, please directly contact us at support@altizure.com, and send us the data in a USB by courier. We will upload the data directly to the cloud.

## Can I upload images to the same project on multiple computers at the same time? {#sametime}

Yes. Our system allows users to upload pictures from different computers simultaneously. That is to say, if you are going to upload photos on two computers, you can put the pictures into two folders and upload them separately on two computers.

You can login to the same account on multiple computers &gt;&gt; Locate the project that you are going to reconstruct &gt;&gt; Click the **Upload **button on the **Overview **page to upload images.

## Requirements on Uploading Images {#requirements}

Support uploading different files with duplicated name. For example, DJI reset file name for every 1000 images. Uploading them all will not overwrite each other.

* We recommend uploading no more than 1000 images in each batch. Otherwise your browser may crash.
