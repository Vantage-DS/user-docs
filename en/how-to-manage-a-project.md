# How to manage a project?

Most of the management functions are listed in details in [Project Overview Page](overview-page.html), [Project Setup Page](setup-page), and [Project Studio Page](project-studio-page). Please take a careful look at these three articles.

* [Transfer a project to another user](#transfer)


## Does the 3D content have GPS information? {#gps}

The 3D reconstruction per se does not need to have any GPS information, so the reconstructed 3D is only in a relative coordinate system by default.

However, if your images are already geo-tagged with GPS information, which is often true when captured by a drone, Altizure is able to read in the GPS information from your images, so the 3D reconstruction will be geo-referenced in the real world coordinate system.

## How can I delete my project? {#delete}
