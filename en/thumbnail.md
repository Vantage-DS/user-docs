## Guidelines

First, you need to open the 3D content in [**Project Setup Page**](setup-page.md#enter):

In the setting mode, you can freely rotate or move your 3D models just like in normal mode. To take a nice thumbnail image, you can follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to a view point which presents the best view of your 3D model.
2. Click the **Set Thumbnail **icon on the right sidebar and the system will take a screenshot of your model.

3. If you are satisfied with the image, click **Set Thumbnail **in the popup dialog and set the screenshot as the thumbnail of your model. Or, you can click **Cancel**, repeat the above steps and re-take a screenshot.

The view point you choose for the thumbnail is also the starting view point of your project when your 3D model is viewed.
