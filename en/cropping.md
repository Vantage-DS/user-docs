## Guidelines

You can find the cropping tool in the [**Project Setup Page**](#setup-page#enter).

Our cropping tool modifies the look of 3D models in a non-destructive way. The tool does not change the underlying mesh models, but just masks the parts you donâ€™t want other users to see. Users can reserve the modification anytime without breaking the original 3D models. Hence, the download assets, e.g. obj models, are not modified. To view the cropped models offline, please download our Altizure Desktop and sync your projects.
