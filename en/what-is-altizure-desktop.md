## Overview {#overview}

With Altizure Desktop, you can manage efficiently your professional data, offline and online, locally on your desktop machines and remotely on the Altizure.com .

Currently, it is _de facto_ an offline 3D viewer!

You can offline view and browse 3D models stored on your local computer. The local viewing is often much faster as there is no internet bandwidth restriction. This allows you to demonstrate your professional project to your clients, in a more convincing manner and even without any internet connection.

The **Local** contains a list of projects stored in your local computer. You can use **Add to Local** to add any local projects into this list for viewing.

The **Remote** lists all your projects on the Altizure cloud once logged-in, using your Altizure account, it is your "My Projects" at altizure. You can download any of downloadable projects. A Pro project is downloadable regardless of being private or public. The projects are synchronized between your local machine and Altizure.com.

When downloading projects, you are synchronizing your Pro project in **Remote** between your local machine and the Altizure cloud. You can also redistribute the downloaded local projects to others, who can then add these projects to **Local** with **Add to Local** .

Last but not least, it is intended that this desktop offline viewer could be **customized** for our professional partners and users. You may send the request to support@altizure.com if you are interested in developing customized desktop applications with your own logo embedded.
