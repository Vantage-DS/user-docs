## Guidelines

First, you need to go to the [**Proejct Setup Page**](setup-page.md#enter). In the Setup Page, there is an **Annotation** function, which allows you to mark up the map and provide description in-place. 

Currently, **only the project owner** can add annotations to the map, while others can only read the annotations.

1. To start with, open up the viewer in **setting mode**.
2. Click **Annotations** icon on the right sidebar, and a left control panel will appear.
3. Click **Add a Pin** on the left sidebar that just appeared, and click to add a point on your 3D map at the place where you want to insert an annotation. In the pop-up dialog, you can write a few words or change the style of the marker point.

You can also embed a video in the annotation. Copy the video code and paste it in **Description **of the pop-up dialog.
