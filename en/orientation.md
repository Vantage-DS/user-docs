You need to first enter the [**Project Setup Page**](setup-page.md#enter) of the model, then click the **Model Orientation** button.

Sometimes, if the photos are not successfully aligned with GPS information, it's difficult for the machine to figure out whether the model is facing south or north. This would end up the model being upside down or not facing the right direction.
