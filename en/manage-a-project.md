# How to manage a project?

Most of the management functions are listed in details in [Project Overview Page](overview-page.md), [Project Setup Page](setup-page.md), and [Project Studio Page](studio-page.md). Please take a careful look at these three articles.


* [Does the 3D content have GPS information?](#gps)
* [Delete a project](#delete)
* [Rename my project](#rename)
* [Transfer a project to another user](#transfer)
* [Upgrade your project to Pro](#upgrade)


## Does the 3D content have GPS information? {#gps}

The 3D reconstruction per se does not need to have any GPS information, so the reconstructed 3D is only in a relative coordinate system by default.

However, if your images are already geo-tagged with GPS information, which is often true when captured by a drone, Altizure is able to read in the GPS information from your images, so the 3D reconstruction will be geo-referenced in the real world coordinate system.

## How can I delete my project? {#delete}

Please go to the [**Overview Page**](overview-page.md) of the project you want to delete \(URL that ends with /overview\). Click **Administration card &gt; Remove **to delete the project.

## How to rename one of my projects? {#rename}

Please take a look at the **Settings Card** in [this article](overview-page.md#settings).

## How to transfer one of my projects to another user? {#transfer}

Please take a look at **Project Transfer** in the [**Admin Card**](overview-page.md#admin).

Please notice that once you transfer the project, you will lose your access to the [Overview Page](overview-page.md), [Setup Page](setup-page.md), and [Studio Page](studio-page.md). You can only use the functions on [3D Model Page](model-page.md).

## How to upgrade my project to Pro? {#upgrade}

Please visit [this page](upgrade-free-to-pro.md).
