# Free vs Professional Projects

The **Differences **between Free and Professional projects are listed on our [**Pricing page**](https://site.altizure.com/pricing\).

A Free project has the same reconstruction resolution as a Pro project.



**Do I need to pay for Altizure?**

No. Without any payment being required, you can try out any number of free projects, which are great places to begin using the essential features of Altizure. When youâ€™re ready to do more, you can upgrade your free projects to Pro project for downloadable results and more powerful features.


**What is the size limit of free projects?**

The free project size limit is 3 GP at the start, but you can increase the limit by publishing high quality results. When one of your public project is featured by Altizure, you will get extra free quota equal to the size of the project. Learn more on [**Free Quota Upgrade Program**](upgrade-your-free-quota.html).

**Can a Free project be converted into a Pro project?**

Yes. You can always starts as a Free project, and if the results are satisfactory, then you convert it into a Pro project. We welcome you to do so, and better understand Altizure.

**Should I upgrade to Pro project?**

Pro project gives you unlimited uploads, more than enough for our professional users to reconstruct huge area in great details. Pro unlocks the raw results for you to download and import into most 3D softwares, and it gives you access to powerful features including mesh editing and GIS tools.

**How can I upgrade to Pro project?**

Please read [this article](upgrade-free-to-pro.html).

**Is it possible to view the data in higher resolution when using a local viewer?**

Possible. This is related to the organization of the large-scale 3D model data, in Level of Details \(LoD\). When you have a powerful viewer \(for example, FBX Review\) to load all the finest-level of models, you are able to view the most detailed models of all parts.
