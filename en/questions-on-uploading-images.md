## Features of Smart Upload {#features}

**Smart Upload:** The upload is **resumable **and can **skip **the already-uploaded files.

1. The upload is **resumable**. So, do not worry if the upload stops when you upload a large number of images, the unfinished part can be resumed when the connection is re-established.

2. The upload **automatically skips** the already-uploaded images if the image file has the same name and the same size.

It is recommended that you simply always\_select all images\_to upload, even if you just want to add few new images into the project. Altizure automatically skip all already-uploaded, and only upload the new images.

If you have very big data, you can also send us the data directly with a USB by courrier. We will upload the data directly to the cloud.

Can I upload images to the same project on multiple computers at the same time?

Yes. Our system allows users to upload pictures from different computers simultaneously. That is to say, if you are going to upload photos on two computers, you can put the pictures into two folders and upload them separately on two computers.

You can login to the same account on multiple computers &gt;&gt; Locate the project that you are going to reconstruct &gt;&gt; Click **Upload **on the **Overview **page to upload images.

## Requirements on Uploading Images {#requirements}

Support uploading different files with duplicated name. For example, DJI reset file name for every 1000 images. Uploading them all will not overwrite each other.

* We recommend uploading no more than 1000 images in each batch. Otherwise your browser may crash.
